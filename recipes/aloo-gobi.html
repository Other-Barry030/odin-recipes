<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Aloo Gobi is a wildly popular Indian curry with potatoes (aloo in Hindi) and cauliflower (gobi in Hindi).</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Butter</strong> or ghee: Used to saut√© the vegetables and add buttery flavor that goes so well with potato dishes (like potato samosas, aloo masala, or aloo naan).</li>
    <li><strong>Onion:</strong> Adds flavor and sweetness to the dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Enhances all of the flavors in the dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Fresh grated ginger and garlic cloves:</strong> yummy aromatic background for the dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Chillies:</strong> Optional for those who prefer their dishes spicier.</li>
    <li><strong>Ginger.</strong> Use minced of grated fresh, juicy ginger.</li>
    <li><strong>Cumin, Turmeric and Garam Masala:</strong> Gives this dish its classic Indian flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Cayenne pepper or Kashmiri Red Chilli Powder:</strong> Add a bit of heat and color to the dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato:</strong> Provides acidity and sweetness to balance out all of the spices in the dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Cauliflower and Potato:</strong> The stars of the show! Cauliflower in small florets combine with diced potato to give this recipe its hearty texture and filling flavor that we love. I prefer yellow or red potato because they hold their shape. Russet potato will break down more for a mashed potato texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Cilantro</strong> (coriander): Fresh cilantro adds a bright freshness to finish off this delicious meal (but it&rsquo;s an optional garnish).</li>

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Melt butter</strong> in a large dutch oven over medium heat, then add onion with some salt and let cook until soft and golden for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Add ginger, garlic & chillies</strong> to the pan and stir until softened for about 1 to 2 minutes more. Now <strong>add your spices</strong> and let them cook until fragrant for about 1 minute more.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir in tomato, cauliflower & potato</strong> then season with additional salt as desired before adding 2 cups water.</li>
    <li><strong>Bring to a boil</strong>, cover then reduce heat slightly and simmer for 10 minutes while stirring occasionally. Uncover after 10 minutes and continue cooking until vegetables are soft & sauce has reduced for 5 to 7 minutes more. </li>

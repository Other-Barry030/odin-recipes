<h1>Samosa</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>These crisp Traditional Potato Samosas are packed with fluffy spiced potatoes, chillies and fresh ginger in a golden pastry crust. So much flavor in one of my favorite authentic Indian recipes</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Potatoes.</strong> Pick russet potatoes for their lovely waxy texture. Yukon gold potato is a great option, too, and baby potatoes will also work. You&rsquo;ll want to remove the peels and cut them in 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
    <li><strong>Oil.</strong> Use an oil with a high smoke point and neutral-tasting flavor to carry the spices in.</li>
    <li><strong>Butter</strong> You can use ghee or plant-based butter if you prefer.</li>
    <li><strong>Onion.</strong> Choose a juicy white onion that is full of sweetness.</li>
    <li><strong>Cumin.</strong> Toasty cumin seeds always put their best food forward.</li>
    <li><strong>Jalapeno.</strong> These give the perfect amount of heat and they won&rsquo;t overpower the whole recipe. You may substitute others like green chillies or Thai red chillies but the samosas will be spicier.</li>
    <li><strong>Ginger.</strong> Use minced of grated fresh, juicy ginger.</li>
    <li><strong>Garam Masala.</strong> Key to the curry flavor and fragrance in these potato samosas.</li>
    <li><strong>Turmeric.</strong> Earthy, glowy turmeric is a must in this filling.</li>
    <li><strong>Cayenne.</strong> I love the little kick from cayenne or chilli powder.</li>
    <li><strong>Peas.</strong> Frozen or fresh green peas will work fine. These add a pop of fresh flavor to the dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Cilantro.</strong> Fresh coriander really lightens the rich filling of this samosa recipe up.</li>
    <li><strong>Flour.</strong> You can use all-purpose flour in the recipe for samosa dough.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil the potatoes</strong> in a pot of salted water until tender but not falling apart. Drain thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat <strong>oil and butter</strong> in a dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. <strong>Add the onion</strong> and cook until soft and golden, about 10 minutes. <strong>Add the cumin seeds</strong> and cook until fragrant, about a minute. </li>
    <li>Next, add <strong>jalapeno and ginger</strong>; cook until softened, about a minute more, then add the salt and remaining spices. </li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low. Add the drained <strong>potatoes and peas</strong> and toss gently but thoroughly to coat. Cook, frequently stirring, until hot. Taste and add more salt if needed. Stir in cilantro. </li>
    <li>To <strong>make the samosa dough</strong>, combine flour and salt in large mixing bowl, then stir in oil. Add water, little by little, to form a workable dough. Form the dough into a ball and wrap in a damp kitchen towel to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li>
    <li>To <strong>shape the samosas</strong>, divide the dough into 6 equal portions, then roll each into a smooth ball on a well-floured surface. Roll each ball into a thin, oblong shape, then use a knife to slice in half lengthwise to make a half-moon. Take one half in your hand, brush some water on the edges, and fold into an open cone shape, pressing edges to seal. Hold the cone and fill with about 2 tbsp potato filling. Pinch to seal Allow it to sit on a cutting board to form a flat bottom. Finish shaping remaining samosas. </li>
    <li>To <strong>fry the samosas</strong>, pour the oil into a deep saucepan or dutch oven to a depth of 3″ over medium heat. Fry the samosas in batches once the oil reaches about 200ºF. Fry for 15 minutes until golden, then increase heat to high and cook for 5 minutes at a hotter temperature until deep golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels to drain. </li>
